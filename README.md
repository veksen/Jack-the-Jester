INTRODUCTION
------------
Hello and welcome to the Jack the Jester project! This is the official repository for any and all resources
relating to the aforementioned project. Here, you can find all the underlying code that makes this bot run (minus the token
and config info, of course!), contribute your ideas to the project, or draw inspiration for your own projects! If you have
any questions, don't hesisitate to join our Discord server (https://discord.gg/xGMYAd9) and ask any of our Devs about the project. For business inquiries, or if you would like to contribute to the project, please DM me on Discord through the server, or email me personally at misfortune.gg@gmail.com. It is HIGHLY reccommended that all contriutors join the Discord server, as that is where we will test and brainstorm new projects.

OVERVIEW
--------
What exactly *is* Jack the Jester? Jack (as we'll refer to him from now on) is the offical bot mascot of Team Misfortune (a mobile eSports team founded by myself), and aims to be a feature-rich Discord bot that includes modules ranging from moderation to music to cross-server communication. And by feature-rich, I mean feature-**rich**. As in, this will be the only bot you'll need in your server kind of rich. We aim to do this by constantly brainstorming new modules to add, *and* by taking suggestions from our server members.

CONTRIBUTING
------------
So you've emailed or messaged me on Discord, and you're a Dev for the project now. What's next? How do I contribute? Unfortunately, because of the way hosting works, and because of various privacy measures I've taken to avoid trolls getting access to the token, contributing is a complicated, multi-step process. Before you begin codimg, read the Guide file to get a feel for how the bot works and how its modules are structured. Once you have a good understanding of the core modules, go ahead and clone the repository, run `npm install` in the cloned directory to install the dependencies, program your module, and submit a pull request. I'll download your work and throw it into the test bot, Jill, for you to test. If everything works as expected and I'm satisfied with it, I'll commit the module to the repo, upload the updated project folder to *Jack's* file, and reload commands as needed. This two-bot system guarantees maximum uptime for Jack, while Jill is used to debug, if need be.
