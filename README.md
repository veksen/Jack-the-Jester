and config info, of course!), contribute your ideas to the project, or draw inspiration for your own projects! If you have
any questions, don't hesisitate to join our Discord server (https://discord.gg/xGMYAd9) and ask any of our Devs about the project. For business inquiries, or if you would like to contribute to the project, please DM me on Discord through the server, or email me personally at misfortune.gg@gmail.com. It is HIGHLY reccommended that all contriutors join the Discord server, as that is where we will test and brainstorm new projects.

OVERVIEW
--------
What exactly *is* Jack the Jester? Jack (as we'll refer to him from now on) is the offical bot mascot of Team Misfortune (a mobile eSports team founded by myself), and aims to be a feature-rich Discord bot that includes modules ranging from moderation to music to cross-server communication. And by feature-rich, I mean feature-**rich**. As in, this will be the only bot you'll need in your server kind of rich. We aim to do this by constantly brainstorming new modules to add, *and* by taking suggestions from our server members.
