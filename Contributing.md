CONTRIBUTING
------------
So you've emailed or messaged me on Discord, and you're a Dev for the project now. What's next? How do I contribute? Unfortunately, because of the way hosting works, and because of various privacy measures I've taken to avoid trolls getting access to the token, contributing is a complicated, multi-step process. Before you begin coding, get a feel for how the bot handles commands, and subsequently, how commands should be structured. The `index.js` and `ping.js` files should prove good examples for this. Once you have a good idea of how the bot works, go ahead and clone the repository and head over to the Project board. You may notice that we have a project open for each module that this bot will include: Moderation, Logging, Music, Games, Party Queues, Databasing, and Content Integration. Each project board has a To Do, In Progress, Ready to Test, and Completed column, which outlines the journey an issue or pull request will take in the stages of development. If you have an idea for a task, or see one that you think you can handle and is unassigned in the To Do section, claim the task by creating a blank file and submitting it
