CONTRIBUTING
------------
So you've emailed or messaged me on Discord, and you're a Dev for the project now. What's next? How do I contribute? Unfortunately, because of the way hosting works, and because of various privacy measures I've taken to avoid trolls getting access to the token, contributing is a complicated, multi-step process. Before you begin codimg, read the Guide file to get a feel for how the bot works and how its modules are structured. Once you have a good understanding of the core modules, go ahead and clone the repository, run `npm install` in the cloned directory to install the dependencies, check the To Do sections of open projects to see what needs to be worked on, program your module, and submit a pull request. I'll download your work and throw it into the test bot, Jill, for you to test. If everything works as expected and I'm satisfied with it, I'll commit the module to the repo, upload the updated project folder to *Jack's* file, and reload commands as needed. This two-bot system guarantees maximum uptime for Jack, while Jill is used to debug, if need be.
